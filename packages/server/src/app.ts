   *
   * What separates "render the app" from "that file does not exist" is

   * configure and share their own links, and a rule like "no dots means
   * an app route" would 404 a real visitor the first time one of those
   * broke the pattern. The honest signal is the client's own: a
   * top-level navigation (`Sec-Fetch-Dest: document`, or an Accept that
   * asks for HTML) means a person is looking at a page, so serve the
   * shell and let the router decide. Anything else is a machine
   * fetching a resource, and a resource we did not serve above is a
   * genuine 404.
   *
   * Worst case for a crawler that claims to want HTML is exactly the
   * old behaviour, and a real browser can never be 404'd out of the
