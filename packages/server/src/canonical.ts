 * crawler that follows a serve link home finds a second copy of the
 * product's pages under a name that was never meant to carry them.
 * Search engines then pick one, and they picked .link.
 *
 * `appUrl` (LV_APP_URL) says which copy is the real one. When it is set,
 * every page of the shell carries `<link rel="canonical">` pointing at
 * the same path on that origin, and the crawl documents (robots.txt's
 * Sitemap line, sitemap.xml's entries) name it too. A one-domain
 * deployment leaves it unset and nothing here happens.
